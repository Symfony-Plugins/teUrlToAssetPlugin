teUrlToAsset plugin
==============

The `teUrlToAssetPlugin` is a symfony plugin that allows convenient access to
"page-specific" assets (images, flash files, documents, etc.) by mapping a
URL to a directory structure and via simple hierarchy finding the most
applicable asset, if any.

Most useful for CMS setups where user needs granular control over which assets
appear where on the site, without cluttering up the user-interface to
upload assets for each page.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        $ symfony plugin:install teUrlToAssetPlugin

  * You're done.

Usage
-----

The plugin class can be used stand-alone, but installed in a symfony project
it will make a new variable "$assets" available in all your templates.

$assets implements the ArrayAccess interface, and it's aware of the current
uri of the page it's on. For example, to find a banner on a page with the uri:

    www.your-site.com/sports/outdoor/hiking

you simple write:

    [php]
    $image = $asset["banner"];

By default this will look for one of the following files (in this order):

    /uploads/banner/sports/outdoor/hiking.jpg
    /uploads/banner/sports/outdoor.jpg
    /uploads/banner/sports.jpg
    /uploads/banner.jpg

The first file that is found is returned. If no file matches, null is returned.

What this enables you to do is specify a banner image for the entire section
"sports", yet override this banner specifically for the section "outdoor".. etc.
As you can see you can even have a default "banner.jpg" to fall back on.

By default the plugin looks for JPG files, but you can specify the file type
like so:

    [php]
    $flash = $assets["banner.swf"]
    $document = $assets["manual.pdf"]
    $audio = $assets["music.mp3"]

This way, you can distribute general and specific assets throughout your site
via the usual upload functionality of your favorite wysiwyg editor,
for example, or an asset manager.

Configuration
-------------

The plugin can be customized via the following settings:

    [yml]
    #app.yml
    all:
      teUrlToAssetPlugin:
        dir: uploads
        template_name: assets

Hope this makes your asset life easier.
